Fields of NLP:
-> Sentiment analysis
-> Topic extraction
-> Search engine
-> Entity extraction
-> Auto complete
-> Chatbots / VA's
-> Speech to text
-> Review rating prediction
-> Question answering
-> Translation


Pre processing text data:
-> Removing weird spaces    :(split the text to words, add " " space to them by join command)
-> Tokenization             :(imp step:                         simple method-nltk word_tokenize function)
-> Spelling correction      :(imp imp step:                     simple method- Peter Norvig's spelling correction)
-> Contraction mapping      :(cause  -  because)
-> Stemming                 :(converts word to root form, ex: fishing to fish, simple method- NLTK stemmers)
-> Emoji handling           :(install emoji library)
-> Stop words handling      :(Find the stop words)
-> Cleaning HTML            :(Format code)


Models to be used:
-> SVM
-> Logistic Regression
-> Gradient Boost
-> Neural Network


Fuzzy features are used in:
-> Spelling check
-> Plagariasm detection
-> DNA Sequence matching
-> Spam filtering

-> Lavenshtein distance or edit distance:Number of primitive operations to convert a string to exact match

-> Above method uses : QRatio, WRatio, TokenSet Ratio, TokenSort Ratio, PartialSet Ratio, PartialSort Ratio, as 
   new features along with original data
   

-> Hashing of words, word embeddings, TF-IDF plus SVD(Singular Value Decomposition)


Word embeddings features
------------------------

1) Spacial distances:
-> Euclidian
-> Manhattan
-> Cosine
-> Canberra
-> Minkowski
-> Braycurtis

2) Stastical features:
-> Skew
-> Kurtosis


-> Word mover's distance : WMD
