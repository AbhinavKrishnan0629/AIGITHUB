-> OCR (Optical Charecter Recognition)

-> MaskRCNN model is very capable of solving computer vision problems, it handles
   1) Object detection   2) Object classification  3) Segmentation
   
   Its a multi task network

-> Tesseract OCR and Apache Tika are some softwares pre build

    Demerits of Tesseract OCR: Computationally expensive, poor handwriting analysis, skewed and distorted images are
    hard to detect, heavily depends on input image quality.
   
-> Text detection models: TextFuseNet, MixNet, DBnet and DBnet++, MaskRCNN, PANet, PSENet, TextSnake, DRRG, FCENet

-> For our project, we will be using TextFuseNet model for text detection.


-> TextFuseNet
----------------
    - Text detectors can be easily affected by complex backgrounds, irregular shapes and texture interference.
    - Existing methods:  1) Charecter based       2) Word based
    - This noval method uses richer fused features to detect texts of arbitrary shape
    - TextFuseNet:  Mask-RCNN + Mask-TextSpotter
    - It performs an instance segmentation task
    - It analyses charecter, word, global level features by altering Mask-RCNN pipeline
