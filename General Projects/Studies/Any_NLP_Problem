=========================================================================================================================





Things to be covered:
-> Working of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non Negative Matrix Factorization, LabelEncoder
-> Stratify splitting
-> TF-IDF, Logistic regression
-> Parameters of TF-IDF, how to tune to get best settings for TF-IDF
-> What is TF-IDF followed by logistic regression means
-> What are linear models and non linear models
-> what is parameter C in logistic Regresion
-> Which model is better for which cases
-> Uses and strength areas of each model
-> How to choose combinations of models


Topics covered:
-> tfidf, count features, logistic regression, svm, xgboost, naive bayes, grid search, word vectors, LSTM,
   GRU, ensembling

-> Always try to start with TF-IDF and CountVectorizer features, they work almost all the time.
