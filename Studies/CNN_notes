4) tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)
5) Import data
6) data numpy iterator can be used
7) Scaling the data
8) Splitting data





First we create an image dataset from pixel values by reshaping into desired shape
then we use pyplot.imshow() with cmap='grey' to show image


The slicing [:, :, 0] in Python is used to select elements from a multi-dimensional array, typically a NumPy array or a TensorFlow tensor. This slicing is used when dealing with multi-channel images or tensors, where the last dimension represents different channels (e.g., RGB channels in an image).

Let's break down what each part of [:, :, 0] does:

The : symbol indicates that we want to select all elements along that axis.
[:, :] indicates that we want to select all elements along the first two dimensions (commonly used for height and width in images).
0 specifies that we want to select only the elements in the last dimension with index 0.
So, [:, :, 0] selects all elements along the first two dimensions and only the elements from the last dimension with index 0.

For example, if you have a 3D array representing an RGB image, [:, :, 0] would select all elements from the first channel (the red channel), leaving you with a 2D array representing the intensity of red at each pixel.
